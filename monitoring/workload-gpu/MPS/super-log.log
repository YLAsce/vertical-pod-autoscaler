torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 860.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 79.10 GiB of which 780.79 MiB is free. Process 300836 has 58.06 MiB memory in use. Process 654052 has 758.00 MiB memory in use. Process 654581 has 3.24 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 2.55 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 5.08 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
